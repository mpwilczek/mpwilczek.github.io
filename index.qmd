I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in Biotechnology and Bioinformatics at the [Roux Institute at Northeastern University](https://roux.northeastern.edu/). Currently, my lab focuses on understanding viral mutation dynamics and using modeling techniques to predict human disease and tissue tropism; find our latest work [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/17/1/12)! In addition, I am passionate about integrating student learning into our research and community outreach to enhance and expand experiential learning opportunities.
