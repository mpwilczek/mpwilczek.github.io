I grew up in Upstate New York and received my Bachelor of Science at the State University of New York at Albany. After graduating, I interned at the New York State Department of Health and volunteered at the Wadsworth Arbovirology lab. There, I found my passion for microbiology and pursued my Ph.D. at the University of Maine. I studied virus-host interactions, using RNA-sequencing and complementary cell-based assays to elucidate the pathways involved during JC polyomavirus infection in astrocytes.

When I am not at my computer or teaching, you can find me hiking with my Australian Shepard, spending time with my family, or playing volleyball.
