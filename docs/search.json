    "text": "I grew up in Upstate New York and got my Bachelor of Science at the State University of New York at Albany. After graduating, I interned at the New York State Department of Health and volunteered at Wadsworth Arbovirology lab. I found my passion for microbiology and pursued my Ph.D.Â at The University of Maine, studying virus-host interactions.\n\nWhen I am not at my desktop or teaching, you can find me hiking with my Australian Shepard, spending time with my family, or playing volleyball."
